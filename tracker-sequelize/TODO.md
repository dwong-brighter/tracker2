# TODO


- sequelize 6.5.0 (2021-03-19)
  - Generic model attribute declarations of the form `extends Model //<ZZZZZZZZAttributes, ZZZZZZZZCreationAttributes>`
  are commented out because Sequelize TypeScript type checking doesn't work for some associations.
  Uncomment after bugfixes are merged, then get updated version of sequelize/sequelize-typescript.
